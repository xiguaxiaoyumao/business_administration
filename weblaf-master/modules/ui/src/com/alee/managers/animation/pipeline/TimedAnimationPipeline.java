/**
 * {@link com.alee.managers.animation.pipeline.AnimationPipeline} implementation that performs animation frames at irregular time intervals
 * based on the delays returned by transitions.
 *
 * A few important notes:
 * 1. Single instance of this pipeline can process any amount of transitions with different frame rate starting at different times
 * 2. This pipeline does not guarantee that each transition frame will be executed exactly in time, but it tries to do so
 * 3. This pipeline do guarantee that each transition frame will be executed sooner or later depending on queue load and other factors
 * 4. Nanoseconds are used as unit of measurement as a more precise way to determine frames position on the timeline
